      Twenty-one is a cardgame played between two participants:
      + Player
      + Dealer

      There are two moves the participants can do:
      + Hit:  The party choosing 'Hit' will add a card to their
              Hand from the deck, randomly.
      + Stay: The party choosing 'Stay' indicates that they are
              done adding cards from the deck to their Hand for
              current and all subsequent turns of the game.

      Card Values:
      2 - 9 : Cards value is equal to the number on the card.
      Ace   : Card value can equal 11 or 1, depending on whether
              their hand will go over 21.
              (e.g.: A Hand of Two Aces has the value of 22 or 12.
                     Since the goal get 21 or just below, value
                     of 12 is the correct value)
      Face  : Face cards include: Jack, Queen, and King, and are
              valued at 10.

      Procedure:
      + Each participant's Hand starts with 2 random cards out of
        a 52-card deck
      + First Turn belongs to the player.
        - As mentioned above, they can choose between two moves:
          'Hit' or 'Stay'
        - If the Player 'Busts' (their Hand's total value over 21)
          after recieving a new card, then they will automatically
          lose, assuming that the Dealer doesn't also 'Bust'.
        - The player's turn is over once they 'Stay'.
      + The Dealer's Turn is next.
        - The dealer must 'Hit' if their Hand's total value is
          less than 17.
        - If the dealer busts, the player wins.
      + Once both dealer and player decides to stay, both Hands
        are revealed.
      + If both Hands have the same total value, its a tie.
      - Otherwise, the Hand's value that is closest to 21, wins!

      Good Luck!
